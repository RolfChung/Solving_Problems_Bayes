# Summary

<p>
The main focus here is <b>probability calculus</b> for solving problems.<br>
The central idea is that calculating probabilities requires an understanding of the events involved an this is more important than the actual mechanical calculations.<br>
For example are the events independent (mutually exclusive) or dependent?<br>
Are the events occurring simultaenously or not, conditional or not?<br>
The probability laws are structuring the understanding of probability
and point to the Bayes' theorem.
</p> 

<p>
However even before probability calculus tools like random number generation
and combinatorics are very helpful for setting the ground and working with problems.

The project here covers topics like:
</p> 

<p>
<ul>
  <li>Random numbers generation</li>
  <li>Combinations and permutations</li>
  <li>Joint probabilities</li>
  <li>Conditional probabilities</li>
  <li>Total Probability</li>
  <li>Bayes theorem</li>
</ul>
